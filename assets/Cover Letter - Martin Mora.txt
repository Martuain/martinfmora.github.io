Cover Letter - Martin Mora Dear Hiring Manager, With over 20 years of experience in software development, product management, and operations, I am confident in my ability to effectively contribute to your team and drive successful outcomes for your company. Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated a strong track record of leading multidisciplinary teams through complex projects, delivering innovative solutions on time and within budget. My expertise spans cutting-edge domains such as agile methodologies, fintech, Web3, AI, Big Data, DevOps, UX/UI, data analytics, and cloud solutions. I am particularly passionate about fostering growth, nurturing positive work environments, and staying ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. In my latest role as Product Delivery Manager at ioBuilders, I leveraged Ethereum-based solutions and agile methodologies to spearhead the development and delivery of groundbreaking products and projects that transformed traditional finance. Key accomplishments include managing a team of over 10 engineers to deliver products and initiatives worth more than €1M in advanced blockchain technology and leading the development of an MVP for private equity tokenization SaaS, built on Hedera DLT. This solution garnered substantial interest from potential partners and clients, showcasing my ability to provide high-impact technical solutions. My experience also includes strategic liaison roles between development and consulting teams, where I improved SaaS platforms and tokenized primary and secondary market securities. I successfully collaborated with esteemed partners such as Renta4, Grupo LAR, BME, and AlquilerSeguro on a consortium-led initiative to tokenize real estate investments, achieving a turnover of €5 million and a tokenized issuance of €470 million over a 5-year horizon. Additionally, my role at PARSER as Operations Engineering Manager involved leading multiple European teams to enhance client relationships and operational efficiency through project development strategies. I implemented solutions on Monday.com to streamline processes, reducing rejected or re-invoiced bills by 75% and employee attrition by 50%. At PARSER -CHECKOUT, I managed delivery across three teams and implemented SDKs that helped merchants save up to 80% of their time on checkout flow integration. My technical and leadership skills, combined with my passion for innovation and problem-solving, make me an ideal candidate. I am eager to bring my expertise to your team and contribute to the success of your projects. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and certifications can benefit your team. Sincerely, Martín Mora
